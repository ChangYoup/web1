<h2>HTML</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a>in the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

 <p><strong>Dating <u>apps</u></strong> know this well, and they’re <strong>working</strong> to make it easier for all of us to hook up (well, those of us who aren’t already happily married – hi honey!).</P>
 <p>But lately it seems finding the right dating app for you is almost as challenging as finding the right person.</p>
 <p>At least people don’t judge you as harshly if you try more than one app at a time.</p>
